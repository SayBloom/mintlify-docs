Learning a new language always starts with the basics - the alphabet and pronunciation. While French may seem daunting at first with its unique sounds and accent marks, with a little practice you'll be speaking like a true Francophone in no time! In this section, we'll cover everything you need to know about the French alphabet and pronunciation rules to build a strong foundation. 

## The French Alphabet

The French alphabet consists of the same 26 letters as the English alphabet:

<Accordion title="See the French Alphabet">
- **A** (ah)
- **B** (bay)
- **C** (say)
- **D** (day)
- **E** (euh)
- **F** (eff)
- **G** (jhay)
- **H** (ahsh)
- **I** (ee)
- **J** (jhee)
- **K** (kah)
- **L** (ell)
- **M** (emm) 
- **N** (enn)
- **O** (oh)
- **P** (pay)
- **Q** (kew)
- **R** (air)
- **S** (ess)
- **T** (tay)
- **U** (ew)
- **V** (vay)
- **W** (doob-leh-vay)
- **X** (eeks)
- **Y** (ee-grehk)
- **Z** (zehd)
</Accordion>

However, there are a few key differences in how they are pronounced. We'll dive into those unique sounds shortly.

### Accent Marks

One aspect of written French that stands out immediately is the liberal use of accent marks. These little symbols may seem confusing at first, but they are very important in French as they guide pronunciation and distinguish between similar words.

There are five accent marks in French:

1. **Acute accent (<Tooltip tip="l'accent aigu">é</Tooltip>)**
2. **Grave accent (<Tooltip tip="l'accent grave">à, è, ù</Tooltip>)** 
3. **Circumflex (<Tooltip tip="l'accent circonflexe">â, ê, î, ô, û</Tooltip>)**
4. **Trema (<Tooltip tip="l'accent tréma">ë, ï, ü</Tooltip>)**
5. **Cedilla (<Tooltip tip="la cédille">ç</Tooltip>)**

<Tip>
Accent marks may not always impact pronunciation, but they matter for spelling and distinguishing words. For example:

- **a** (has) vs **à** (to) 
- **sur** (on) vs **sûr** (sure)
</Tip>

## French Pronunciation Rules

French pronunciation can seem tricky for English speakers because the rules differ quite a bit between the two languages. However, French is actually very consistent in how letters and combinations of letters are pronounced. Once you learn the rules, you can accurately pronounce any French word you encounter! 

<Info>
Unlike English, French is a **syllable-timed language**. This means syllables are pronounced with equal emphasis and duration. Practice really extending those vowel sounds!
</Info>

Let's go through the key pronunciation rules to know.

### Vowels

French vowels can have multiple pronunciations depending on the letters around them. Here are the general rules:

- **a**: Pronounced like "ah" as in f<Tooltip tip="a">*a*</Tooltip>ther 
- **e**: Varies a bit. In general, pronounced like "eh" as in b<Tooltip tip="e">*e*</Tooltip>d, but can also sound like "ay" as in b<Tooltip tip="a">*a*</Tooltip>y or be silent at the ends of words
- **i**: Pronounced like "ee" as in s<Tooltip tip="ee">*ee*</Tooltip>  
- **o**: Pronounced like "oh" as in l<Tooltip tip="o">*o*</Tooltip>w
- **u**: Pronounced like a cross between "ee" and "oo" - round your lips as if saying "oo" but say "ee"

<Accordion title="Vowel Combinations">
French loves to combine vowels, which create some unique but consistent sounds. Some of the major vowel combinations:

- **ou**: Pronounced "oo" like in t<Tooltip tip="oo">*oo*</Tooltip>
- **oi**: Pronounced "wah" like in w<Tooltip tip="a">*a*</Tooltip>ter
- **au/eau**: Pronounced "oh" like in fl<Tooltip tip="o">*o*</Tooltip>w  
- **ai/ei**: Pronounced "eh" like in d<Tooltip tip="a">*a*</Tooltip>y
- **eu/oeu**: Pronounced "uh" like in s<Tooltip tip="u">*u*</Tooltip>n (a bit shorter than the "oo" sound)
</Accordion>

### Consonants 

Many consonant sounds are similar to English, with a few notable exceptions:

- **c**: Pronounced like "k" before a, o, u; pronounced like "s" before e, i, y
- **ç**: Always pronounced like "s"
- **g**: Pronounced like hard "g" before a, o, u; pronounced like "zh" before e, i, y 
- **h**: Always silent
- **j**: Pronounced like "zh" (as in vi<Tooltip tip="s">*s*</Tooltip>ion)
- **q**: Always followed by "u", pronounced as a hard "k" sound
- **r**: Pronounced from the back of the throat, sounding close to a light gargle (hard to describe, must be heard!)
- **s**: Pronounced like "s" at the beginning of words and before/after consonants; pronounced like "z" between vowels

<Note>
Many French consonants have different pronunciation rules than in English. Always remember:

- "h" is silent
- "th" sounds like "t" 
- "ch" sounds like "sh"
- The French "r" is guttural
</Note>

### Liaisons and Silent Letters

A tricky part of French pronunciation is that, oftentimes, the final consonants of words are silent. However, when the following word starts with a vowel sound, that normally-silent consonant is pronounced, attached to the next word. This is called a <Tooltip tip="liaison">liaison</Tooltip>.

<Accordion title="Examples of Liaisons">
- **les amis**: Normally the "s" in "les" is silent, but here it is pronounced like a "z" connecting to "amis"
- **un homme**: The usually-silent "n" in "un" is pronounced connecting to "homme"  
- **ils ont**: The usually-silent "s" in "ils" is pronounced like a "z" connecting to "ont"
</Accordion>

There are some consonants that, when at the end of a word, are usually pronounced: B, C, F, K, L, Q, R. Nearly all other consonants are usually silent when at the end of a word - unless there's a liaison!

<Warning>
Like many things in French, there are some exceptions to liaisons and silent letters. Notably, an "h" at the beginning of a word sometimes blocks a liaison and is called an "<Tooltip tip="h aspiré">h aspiré</Tooltip>". Example: *les | haricots* (no liaison).  
</Warning>

## Practicing French Sounds

Mastering French pronunciation is all about practice, so let's try some exercises to get comfortable with those French sounds!

### Minimal Pairs

Minimal pairs are sets of words that vary by only a single sound. Practicing these similar yet distinct words will train your ear to the unique sounds of French.

<Steps>
<Step>
**tout** (all) --- **tu** (you)
- *Tout le monde aime le chocolat.* (Everyone likes chocolate.) 
- *Tu aimes le chocolat.* (You like chocolate.)
</Step>

<Step>
**bon** (good) --- **vont** (go)
- *C'est un bon livre.* (It's a good book.)
- *Ils vont au cinéma.* (They're going to the movies.)
</Step>
<Step>

**fée** (fairy) --- **fait** (done/fact)  
- *La fée a de la magie.* (The fairy has magic.)
- *C'est un fait intéressant.* (It's an interesting fact.)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Listening for small changes in sounds is key to understanding and being understood. Pay special attention to vowels, liaisons, and silent letters when practicing minimal pairs.
</Tip>

### Tongue Twisters

What better way to practice pronunciation than with silly phrases designed to trip up your tongue? Try repeating these French <Tooltip tip="tongue twisters">virelangues</Tooltip> to improve your accent and fluency:

<Accordion title="French Tongue Twisters">

- **Un chasseur sachant chasser doit savoir chasser sans son chien.** (A hunter who knows how to hunt must know how to hunt without his dog.)

- **Cinq chiens chassent six chats.** (Five dogs hunt six cats.)

- **Les chaussettes de l'archiduchesse sont-elles sèches ou archi-sèches ?** (Are the archduchess's socks dry or very dry?)

- **Ton thé t'a-t-il ôté ta toux ?** (Has your tea taken away your cough?) 

</Accordion>

<Info>
Tongue twisters are a great way to practice tricky French sounds in a fun way. They also help build fluency by getting you used to the rhythm and flow of the language. Have fun with them!
